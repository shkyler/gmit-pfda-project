    "The objective of this project is to sythesise a data set based on some real world phenomenon. This requires investigation in to the pheonmenon and then using  the `numpy.random` package in Python [2] to simulated some data based on this. The problem statement for the assignment is as follows [3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "1. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "1. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "1. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Choice of real world phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "I am currently working in operations at a malt production facility in Ireland. Malting is a process whereby raw cereal grains (barley mainly) are re-hydrated to siumlated planting in soil, and then let germinate for a number of days. During this germination process the cellular structure of the grain is modified, releasing sugars. The grain is then kilned to stop the germination process while drying the grain, fixing the properties of the grain, and improving the colour and flavour characterisitcs of the final product. \n",
    "\n",
    "Worldwide, the largest consumers of malted barley are the brewing and distilling industries [4], using 96% of all malt produced. The most important property of any brewing or distilling malt is its *extract potential* which determines how much sugar is available for conversion to alcohol in the brewing (beer production)/distilling (whiskey production) process [5]. Distillers are particularly interested in *spirit yield* to determine how much many litres of alcohol they are likely to get from each tonne of malt purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maltster's role in this process is to take a natural raw material and create a consistent product, which maximises the extract potential and spirit yield for their customers. There are many factors in the process which can influence the final extract potential and spirit yield. For this project we are only going to consider the relationship between the protein levels in the raw barley and the final extacts and predicted spirit yields (PSY).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section I will outline a brief overview of the malting process. This should give a broad understanding of where the data set comes from, how the variables in it are expected to relate to one another, and how these relationships may be influenced by other factors. \n",

    "### 2.2 Barley Growing and Harvesting\n",
    "The first and perhaps most important stage in the process is the barely growing and harvesting stage. The the agronomic program given to a field of barley during its growing season can help determine the level of nitrogen and hence protein in the grain. In Ireland, Spring malting barley is typically sown in March and harvested in August [7]. During this growing season, the grower is responsible for ensuring that the agonomic program used optimises the nitrogen content in the grain while balancing this with a good yield per acre sown. In Ireland,  there is a requirement for approximately 70% brewing barley and 30% distilling barely for any given harvest year. The maximum protein level allowed for distilling barely is 9.3% [8]. Barley for brewing can be accepted up to 10.8% [6]. During the growing season the farmer will apply a nitrogen based fertiliser to improve the growth in the barley. This will improve the yield per acre for the farmer. However, if too much fertiliser is applied (or it applied too late in the season) the nitrogen levels in the harvested barley will be higher [9], [10] . This barely will be unsuitable for making distilling malt, and may even be rejected for brewing if the protein levels are too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/spraying.jpg\" width=\"650\"/></p>\n",
    "   <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <b><I><a href=\"https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/new-fertiliser-rules-winter-barley/\">Barley Spraying</a></I></b> </p>  \n",
    "   \n",
    "Another aspect that impacts protein levels in the grain is the weather during the growing season. When the plants are growing the nitrogen levels in the corn is higher earlier in the growing season. The nitrogen comes from the soil and the fertiliser applied. Later in the season as the barley ripens, ready for harvesting, more starch arrives in the grains as they increase in size. If the barley growing season is too dry, the barley will ripen early before there is time for the grains to fill out with starch. This will result in higher protein barley.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Barley Intake, Drying and Storage\n",
    "Once the grower believes that the barley is ready to be harvested, a sample is taken and tested for moisture and protein. Once the moisture and protein are in specification as agreed with the maltster, the farmer will proceed to cut the barley. When the barley arrives at the intake, it is tested for moisture and protein. The maltster will then segregate the barley based on the variety and protein content. Some stores will be allocated to ditilling barely (lowest protein), while others will be allocated to brewing. Most years there are 4 to 5 different barley varieties sown, as they each have different properties. This allows the maltster to blend the correct mix of them together to ensure the malt is right for brewing and distilling. \n",
    "\n",

    "   <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <b><I><a href=\"http://www.ukmalt.com/barley-requirements\">Barley Sampling at Intake</a></I></b> </p> \n",
    "\n",
    "The moisture level in the freshly cut barley is usually in the range of 15-21%. Barley at this moisture level is unsafe for long term storage as the grain will start to respire in storage and generate heat. This heat is conducive to microbial growth [11]. Grain at this moisture is also susecptible to mite infestation. Therefore the barely must be dried to below 13% moisture for safe storage. All barley storage areas have aeration systems that are used to cool the barley to below 13<sup>o</sup>C. This is done to prevent hot spots forming in the grain bulk. Note that barley may often be have to stored safely for up to 18 months before some of it used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Steeping\n",
    "Once the barley is required for malting, the maltster will take a batch of malt from a store (using either higher or lower protein barley depending on whether a brewing or distilling malt is required). The first process step in the maltings is steeping. Steeping is the controlled rehydration of the barley. For the maltster, the desired output from this process is to have the barley moisture in the region of 44-46%. Also, the grain should have begun to respire and generate heat. The temperature in the grain should have risen to approximately 18<sup>o</sup>C [12]. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "   \n",
    "Higher protein barley is harder than lower protein barley. The effect of this is that it makes it more difficult for higher protein barley to take on water during the steeping phase [13]. Therefore, the maltster must select a steeping regime to adequately rehydrate the barely. Some of the controls available are:\n",
    "1. Selecting the appropriate 'wet' and 'dry' times. Rather that keeping the barely under water for many hours, the stepping process is usualy broken into 2 or 3 wet periods with dry air breaks between then to allow respiriation to start and heat to build. The water is drained from the grain at the end of the wet periods. A typical 2-wet steeping program is 7 hours wet with 15 hour air break, then 12 hours wet and a 4 hour air break.\n",
    "1. Deciding on the water temperature to be used. Unheated steep water is usually about 8-10<sup>o</sup>C. This can be heated to 13-16<sup>o</sup>C to improve water uptake.\n",
    "1. CO<sub>2</sub> extraction speed. During the air break the grain respires and starts to generate CO<sub>2</sub>. Fans are used to remove this. During the first air break, the speed of the fans can be slowed to allow some heat generate in the grain. This heat will improve water uptake in the second wet - but it must be balanced with the need to remove CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygenate the grain during the dry phase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.5 Germination\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of steeping is to initiate grain growth through hydration. Once the grain is sufficiently hydrated, the germination process can begin [14]. The hydration of the grain starts a process whereby enzymes are released in the grain. These enzymes change the cellular structure of the grain. This is happeding naturally as the barley grain is a seed that wants to grow into a plant. The cellular structure is changing to allow some of the starch in the grain to be used as energy to start this growth. The maltster is looking for this process to commence so that:\n",
    "1. Hard $\\beta$ - glucan material in the cell wall breaks down (this makes malt easier to mill and brew)\n",
    "1. Protein begins to solubilise - this provides yeast nutrition in the fermentation process\n",
    "1. The sugars are released in the grain - required for fermentation into alcohol\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the process, must be carefully controlled so that, all grains in a batch are modified evenly and that the grain does not become over modified - this happens when a batch goes too far. The consequences of over modification are loss of extract and PSY as the grain uses energy trying to grow into a plant, and loss of malting yield as much of the weight of the grain is lost through rootlet growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schematic of the germination process is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/germination.JPG\" width=\"700\"/></p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "   <b><I>Germination Vessel Schematic</I></b> \n",
    "   \n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "1. Humidified air is blown through a perforated floor to aerate the grain bed\n",
    "1. Heat generated by the grain is recirculated to pre heat this humidified air\n",
    "1. The temperature of the grain is controlled by measuring the temperature below and above the grain and settig the fan speed and reciculation flap position as required\n",
    "1. The grain is turned regularly to improved airflow and prevent the rootletsfrom the grain from matting together\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct control of this process will have a direct impact on the PSY and extracts in the final malt\n",
